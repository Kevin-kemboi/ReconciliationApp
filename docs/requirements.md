## AI Feature Specifications

### Column Mapping Intelligence
The system employs natural language processing techniques to automatically identify and map CSV column headers to standardized field names. The mapping algorithm uses keyword matching with confidence scoring to handle variations in column naming conventions.

**Supported Field Mappings:**
- Transaction Reference: id, reference, txn_id, transaction_id, ref, txn_ref, trans_id
- Amount: amount, value, total, sum, price, cost, fee, charge
- Status: status, state, condition, stage, phase
- Date: date, time, timestamp, created, processed
- Currency: currency, curr, ccy

### Anomaly Detection System
The application implements multiple machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious or unusual transactions that require manual review.

**Detection Methods:**
- **Isolation Forest**: Unsupervised learning algorithm for outlier detection in transaction amounts
- **Statistical Analysis**: Variance calculation for amount discrepancies exceeding 5% threshold
- **Pattern Recognition**: Rule-based detection of critical status mismatches (e.g., Processed vs Failed)

**Risk Classification:**
- **Low Risk**: Standard transactions with minor or no discrepancies
- **Medium Risk**: Transactions with moderate anomalies detected by ML algorithms
- **High Risk**: Transactions with significant amount variances or critical status conflicts

## User Experience Design

1. User accesses the web application through a modern browser
2. Drag-and-drop or click to upload two CSV files (internal and provider)
3. System validates files and displays upload progress
4. AI performs automatic column mapping with results shown to user
5. Backend processes files and performs transaction reconciliation
6. Results displayed in categorized tables with visual highlighting
7. AI insights presented in dashboard with anomaly detection results
8. User reviews results and exports data in preferred format

### Visual Design Principles

- **Orange**: Amount mismatches requiring attention
- **Red**: Status conflicts or provider-only transactions
- **Purple**: AI-detected anomalies flagged for review
- **Yellow**: Internal-only transactions not found in provider data

## Quality Assurance
